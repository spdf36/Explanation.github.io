    <H1>Question asked by ma'am</H1>
    <H4>Q. Did you guys paste accepted links again?? Yes or no? With changed Google drive links?</H4>
<H4>Sahil himself is not sure of what he is trying to convey he had said "or tum accept link ko uthakr niche cut paste kr dete ho uska kya??
"</H4>
<H4>but the screenshots that he provided to support his statement shows something else.</H4>

<p>It shows that a set/link which was rejected under "not a native american" was pasted under different ethnicity the next day.
<br>
some sets were pasted again but not accepted ones. The sets which were pasted again were rejected under not a native american
and so were pasted under different ethnicity.</p>

<H5>ABDUL - GTS_50935 - MAIN SHEET</H5>
<p><H4>Abdul claimed that this set was accepted first then it was rejected 2 days later. 
    He wasn't informed about that his set have been rejected 2 days after being accepted.

<H5>AKASH - Rework SHEET - 51087</H5>
<H4>Sahil said on this claim - "ye kl hi tumne change kri h reject krne k bad edit history naam ki bhi chez hoti h"</H4>
<p>
    <br>
    So let's break it down from the start;
    Akash Provided the set on 12/04/2023 which was rejected on 13/04/2023 by sahil for "one outdoor image is not looks
    like outdoor and one id is not suitable as hair on shoulder" ok fair enough! Akash then asks the vendor for rework
    on the mentioned mistakes on 13 <sup>th</sup> of april, Tuesday at 8:51 p.m. The vendor provides the rework on same
    day after 32 minutes i.e, 9:23 p.m 13th April.
    <br>
    Akash pastes the rework in the rework sheet at 2:01a.m on 14<sup>th</sup> of April.
    <br>
    This also gets rejected by Jyoti under same statement "one outdoor image is not lookslike outdoor and one id is 
    not suitable as hair on shoulder". What a coincidence, the rejection is same word by word as it is was copied
    and pasted.
    <br>
    Is someone that dumb that he will paste the set with same mistakes in the rework sheet.
    <br>
    The rework was provided at 2:01a.m of 14<sup>th</sup> of April 2023, effectively on 13<sup>th</sup> night as per our shift.
    QC was done by Jyoti at 4:01p.m of 14<sup>th</sup> of April 2023.
    The question is still the same - If vendor had provided the corrected set why would he paste the rejected set?

    <H5>Ravi - MAIN & REWORK SHEET</H5>
    <p>This set was pasted by Ravi on 12/04/2023 and was rejected by Sahil on 13<sup>th</sup> of April 2023 under "images 
       in car is not allowed "</p>. Valid rejection. Then he provided the rework on 13/04/2023, but then it is rejected by 
       Jyoti on 14<sup>th</sup> of april citing different reason.
       <br>
       The question is why is it that all the rejections are not mentioned at once?

<p>This is just the report of 14<sup>th</sup> of April.
<br>
Wasn't it valid to raise our issues over the questionable quality checks which have been going on for quite a while now.
<br>
<H2>90 sets have been rejected as not a native american between 25<sup>th</sup> of february and 04<sup>th</sup> of April
wasn't any set out of those 90 which can't work with other ethnicity?
